This Budget Tracker App allows users to see a visual, 
and dynamically generated graph as transactions are submitted to the list. 
The user enters a "transaction name" and amount, which can either be added (+) or
take away (-) from the budget.
With each transcation/purchase the shape of the graph will be reflected and show how much money in the hole 
or how much has been saved.
